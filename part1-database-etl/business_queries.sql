-- Query 1: Customer Purchase History
-- Business Question:
-- "Generate a detailed report showing each customer's name, email,
-- total number of orders placed, and total amount spent.
-- Include only customers who have placed at least 2 orders and
-- spent more than ₹5,000. Order by total amount spent in descending order."
--
-- Requirements:
-- Must join: customers, orders, order_items tables
-- Use GROUP BY with HAVING clause
-- Calculate aggregates: COUNT of orders, SUM of amounts
-- Expected Output Columns:
-- customer_name | email | total_orders | total_spent

-- Order by total revenue descending."
--
-- Requirements:
-- Must join: products, order_items tables
-- Use GROUP BY with HAVING clause
-- Calculate: COUNT(DISTINCT), SUM aggregates
-- Expected Output Columns:
-- category | num_products | total_quantity_sold | total_revenue

-- Requirements:
-- Use window function (SUM() OVER) for running total OR subquery
-- Extract month from order_date
-- Group by month
-- Order chronologically
